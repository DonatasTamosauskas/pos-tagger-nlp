       " 'These fiscal pressures are also a factor in shaping the Poland package , and while more ambitious authorizing legislation is still pending , the appropriations bill in conference will be more decisive on U.S. aid to Eastern Europe .',\n",
       " 'To accommodate the additional cash assistance , the House Appropriations Committee last week was required to reallocate an estimated $ 140 million from the Pentagon .',\n",
       " 'And though the size of the loan guarantees approved yesterday is significant , recent experience with a similar program in Central America indicates that it could take several years before the new Polish government can fully use the aid effectively .',\n",

       " 'The House and Senate are divided over whether the United Nations Population Fund will receive any portion of these appropriations , but the size of the increase is itself significant .',\n",

       " 'About a quarter of this share has already been reallocated , according to the industry , but the remaining 23,403 tons are still a lucrative target for growers because the current U.S. price of 18 cents a pound runs as much as a nickel a pound above the world rate .',\n",
       " 'The potential sales are nearly $ 9.3 million , and House Majority Whip William Gray ( D. , Pa . ) began the bidding this year by proposing language that the quota be allocated to English-speaking countries of the Caribbean , such as Jamaica and Barbados .',\n",

       " 'Jamaica , wary of upsetting its Caribbean Basin allies , has apparently instructed its lobbyist to abandon the provision initially drafted by Mr. Gray , but the greater question is whether Mr. Inouye , who has strong ties to the sugar industry , is able to insert a claim by the Philippines .',\n",
